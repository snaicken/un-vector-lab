\begin{abstract}
After Brexit, the US presidential election, and the socio-economic changes brought about by disruptive technologies, the world is facing a myriad geopolitical scene.  Both governments and multinational companies are trying to understand the history of international relations, its current state and how it may change.  How can we do this? Using code and vectors.

One component of international relations is the United Nations General Assembly and the votes cast by nations when sessions are convened.  You have recently been appointed to the role of data scientist by an African government which wishes to maximise its influence in the assembly. Using mathematics, you will be investigating various questions raised by ministers to help guide policy making.
